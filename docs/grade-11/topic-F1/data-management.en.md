    - The need for data management
    - The main tasks involved in managing data

## The need for data management

Data plays an increasingly important role in today’s society. It is a vital resource that helps individuals and organizations work and operate efficiently.

Nearly all individuals and organizations need to manage data. Effective data management brings many benefits, such as:

- Well-organized data improves efficiency, reduces effort and costs from manual entry and repetitive tasks, and streamlines workflows.

- Accurate and reliable data enables trend analysis, opportunity identification, risk reduction, and better decision-making.

- Good data management supports personal and organizational growth, enables business scaling, ensures data security, and helps comply with laws and ethical standards.

On the other hand, when dealing with large volumes of data, using database management systems and specialized software is far more effective than paper records or scattered files and folders.

Moreover, data management requires a balanced combination of technology, processes, and people. Therefore, in many cases, using computers for data management is a smart and practical choice.

## Main tasks in data management

Data management includes the following key activities:

### Collection

**Data collection** is the process of **gathering data from various sources** using methods like paper forms, software applications, sensors, or other data providers.

Examples:

- Students submit paper admission forms.
- Or students fill out admission information on the school’s website.

### Storage and organization

Data must be **stored and organized in a specific structure**, depending on data volume, organizational scale, budget, and other factors. Good storage and organization make it easy to search and retrieve data when needed.

Examples:

Student data can be stored:

- In paper files, placed in cabinets according to classification.
- Or in digital files, organized into different folders.

### Updating

**Data updating** involves:

- **Adding** new data
- **Editing** existing data
- **Deleting** outdated data

It also includes creating different versions of data.

Updating ensures data remains accurate, up-to-date, and reliable.

Examples:

- Adding a record for a new transfer student.
- Editing a student’s class or updating grades when changes occur.

### Exploitation

**Data exploitation** (retrieval and analysis) includes:

- **Searching** for data
- **Extracting** data
- **Sorting** data
- **Calculating statistics**
- **Analyzing** data

The goals of data exploitation are to ensure it is:

- Easy
- Fast
- Accurate
- Done with proper user permissions

Examples:

- Quickly finding a student’s full record when needed.
- Calculating average grades and ranking academic performance.
